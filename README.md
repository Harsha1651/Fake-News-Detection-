The Fake News Detection System is a comprehensive solution designed to automatically identify and classify news articles as either fake or real.<br> With the proliferation of misinformation in the digital age, this project aims to leverage natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and deep learning techniques <br> to provide an accurate and efficient means of combating fake news. The system can be deployed as a web service, API, or integrated into existing platforms to flag and filter out potentially misleading information.
